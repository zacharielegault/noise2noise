# Noise2Noise for SEM image denoising
This is my repo for my Individual Integrated Project where I worked on image denoising for SEM using Noise2Noise. I unfortunalely cannot  make the images available here as I do not have the right to share them.

| sigma | PSNR (dB) |
|:-----:|:---------:|
|   10  |   29.57   |
|   20  |   26.19   |
|   30  |   24.44   |

Adding higher noise lowers the PSNR, but leads to visually better results by removing the noise that was already in the "ground truth" images.
